The following variables are available for use in your custom template:

cssDependencies : includes all the styles needed for the Jasmine HtmlReporter.
javascriptDependencies : includes all the javascript for jasmine.
reporter : the name of the jasmine reporter being used. This will be HtmlReporter during the jasmine:bdd goal and JsApiReporter during the jasmine:test goal.
sourceEncoding : the encoding to be used in the runner.
preloadScriptTags : this renders script tags for each of the scripts specified using the preloadSources parameter.
sourceScriptTags : this renders script tags for each of the sources found in the directory specified using the jsSrcDir parameter.
specScriptTags : this renders script tags for each of the specs found in the directory specified using the jsTestSrcDir parameter.
allScriptTags : this is a convenience variable the renders script tags for the preloads, then the sources, and finally the specs.
preloadsList : this renders a javascript array containing each of the scripts specified using the preloadSources parameter.
sourcesList : this renders a javascript array containing each of the sources found in the directory specified using the jsSrcDir parameter.
specsList : this renders a javascript array containing each of the specs found in the directory specified using the jsTestSrcDir parameter.
allScriptsList : this renders a javascript array containg all the scripts in the following order: preloads, sources, specs.
sourceDir : the path to the sources when deployed to the jetty server. Should be the same as the srcDirectoryName parameter.
specDir : the path to the specs when deployed to the jetty server. Should be the same as the specDirectoryName parameter.
customRunnerConfiguration : this renders the contents of the file specified by the customRunnerConfiguration parameter. Use this is you want to provide a way for adding some external customization to you template. It is most likely not that useful though if you are already writing a custom template.
autoRefresh : this is a boolean indicating whether or not the page should be refreshed automatically at an interval. It will be true with the autoRefreshInterval plugin parameter is greater than 0 and the jasmine:bdd goal is being used.
autoRefreshInterval : the interval at which the page should be automatically refreshed. Should be the same as the autoRefreshInterval parameter.
These variables were used in older versions of the plugin and have been kept for backwards compatibility. They should be considered deprecated and will be removed in a later version of the plugin.

sources : this is a synonym for the allScriptTags variable. If you have a template using this variable you should replace it with allScriptTags.
priority : this is a synonym for the preloadsList variable. If you have a template using this variable you should replace it with preloadsList.
requirejsPath : this will be the full path to the script loader specified using the scriptLoaderPath parameter (which is also deprecated). Instead of using this variable you should just include your script loader as a preload source and then use the preloadScriptTags variable.
